The witness is single-threaded (one item per patrol cycle), so at high throughput it becomes a bottleneck. Zombie polecats accumulate waiting for witness processing. This is a regression — polecats used to be self-managed, with the witness only intervening for genuinely stuck cases.\n\nDESIRED STATE: Polecats self-manage their full lifecycle: push branch, submit MR to refinery, update their bead (close/complete), tear down their own worktree. The witness role returns to being an observer — it patrols for stuck/zombie polecats and intervenes only when something is wrong. No mail-based handoff for routine completions.\n\nINVESTIGATION NEEDED:\n1. Where did the witness-dependency creep in? Trace the polecat completion path and identify where it now requires witness action vs where it used to self-complete.\n2. What state updates does the witness currently perform that the polecat could do itself?\n3. Is the mail-based notification necessary at all, or can the witness discover completion state by polling beads (Discover Don't Track)?\n4. Propose a decoupled design where polecats self-clean and the witness is purely reactive.\n\nThis is a design task — produce a design doc, not code.","design":"Design doc: docs/design/polecat-self-managed-completion.md\n\nSUMMARY: Decouple polecat lifecycle from witness by having polecats self-manage completion.\n\nTHREE CHANGES:\n1. Polecat sets agent_state=idle directly in gt done (skip done intermediate state)\n2. Polecat nudges refinery directly (skip witness relay for MERGE_READY)\n3. Witness removes completion-processing code (patrol focuses on anomaly detection only)\n\nMIGRATION: Three phases — (1) dual-signal, (2) self-transition, (3) cleanup of witness code.\n\nROOT CAUSE: Witness dependency crept in via gt-4ac (persistent model) and gt-a6gp (nudge-over-mail) which centralized completion discovery in witness patrol. The refinery already discovers MRs by polling beads, making the witness relay redundant.\n\nIMPACT: Completion latency drops from 30s-3min to ~0s. Concurrent completions become parallel instead of serial. Witness patrol time reduced.

The formula system is the RIGHT way to configure agent behavior. Look for: things that should be formulas but aren't, formula features that exist but aren't used, places where Go code duplicates what formulas should express. Are all agent roles, schedules, thresholds, and behavior policies formula-driven? File beads for gaps found.","design":"# Formula System Completeness Review\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe formula system (47 embedded formulas, 4 types) provides excellent coverage for\nworkflow orchestration (patrol loops, polecat work lifecycle, convoy reviews). However,\nsignificant gaps exist in three areas: (1) advanced TOML features declared in formulas\nbut NOT parsed by the Go package, (2) hardcoded agent behavior that should be\nformula-driven, and (3) duplicated constants/policies spread across many files.\n\n## Gap Category A: Unparsed Formula Features (Silent Data Loss)\n\nThe Go `internal/formula/types.go` Formula struct has NO fields for these TOML\nsections. They are silently ignored during parsing — formulas declare them, but\nthe runtime never sees them:\n\n| Feature | Used in formulas | Go parsing | Status |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|\n| extends = [\"...\"] | shiny-enterprise, shiny-secure | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [compose] / [[compose.expand]] | shiny-enterprise | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [compose] aspects = [...] | shiny-secure | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [[advice]] / [advice.around] | security-audit | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [[pointcuts]] with glob | security-audit | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [squash] with trigger/template | 12 dog/infra formulas | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [presets] | code-review | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| gate = { type, condition } | mol-shutdown-dance | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n| [[steps.children]] (parallel container) | mol-gastown-boot | NOT PARSED | Dead feature |\n\n**Impact**: Authors write these features thinking they work. The bd tool MAY\nhandle some (needs cross-repo verification), but the gt formula package — the\nprimary parser and validator — silently drops them. No validation, no errors.\n\n## Gap Category B: Hardcoded Behavior That Should Be Formula-Driven\n\n### B1: Role Taxonomy (10+ files, ~15 switch blocks)\nThe role set {mayor, deacon, witness, refinery, polecat, crew, boot, dog} is\nhardcoded in switch/if statements across 10+ files. Adding a new role requires\nmodifying all of them. Should be a declarative role registry.\n\n**Key duplications:**\n- isAutonomousRole(): runtime.go, claude/settings.go, gemini/settings.go (3 copies)\n- Role-to-session-name: daemon/lifecycle.go AND tui/feed/stuck.go (2 copies)\n- Role-to-mail-address: cmd/mail_identity.go (2 switch blocks)\n- Role-to-home-dir: cmd/role.go\n- Role-to-status-line: cmd/statusline.go\n\n### B2: Patrol Molecule Names (5+ files)\nThe strings \"mol-deacon-patrol\", \"mol-witness-patrol\", \"mol-refinery-patrol\"\nappear in 21 Go files. The role→patrol-formula mapping should be metadata on\neither the role or the formula, not scattered string constants.\n\n### B3: Operational Thresholds (30+ constants across 12+ files)\nAll agent behavior thresholds are Go constants, not formula vars:\n\n| Threshold | Value | Files defining it |\n|-----------|-------|-------------------|\n| GUPP violation | 30 min | tui/feed/stuck.go, daemon/lifecycle.go, witness/handlers.go (3x) |\n| Hung session | 30 min | daemon/daemon.go (duplicate of GUPP) |\n| Mass death window | 30s | daemon/daemon.go |\n| Mass death count | 3 | daemon/daemon.go |\n| Dog idle timeout | 1h | daemon/handler.go |\n| Dog removal timeout | 4h | daemon/handler.go |\n| Max dog pool size | 4 | daemon/handler.go |\n| Refinery claim TTL | 30 min | refinery/types.go |\n| Max retry count | 5 | refinery/types.go |\n| Wisp max age | 24h | daemon/wisp_reaper.go |\n| Wisp delete age | 7d | daemon/wisp_reaper.go |\n| Mail delete age | 30d | daemon/wisp_reaper.go |\n| Crash loop window | 15 min | daemon/restart_tracker.go |\n| Crash loop count | 5 | daemon/restart_tracker.go |\n| Max backoff | 10 min | daemon/restart_tracker.go |\n| Max bead respawns | 2 | witness/spawn_count.go |\n| Doctor dog interval | 5 min | daemon/doctor_dog.go |\n| Compactor interval | 24h | daemon/compactor_dog.go |\n| Maintenance interval | 5 min | daemon/scheduled_maintenance.go |\n| Maintenance threshold | 1000 commits | daemon/scheduled_maintenance.go |\n\n### B4: Per-Role Startup Protocols (prime_output.go)\nThe outputPrimeContextFallback function contains 7 large hardcoded strings —\none per role — that serve as system prompts. These are effectively inline\nformulas that define role behavior, but they're Go string literals instead\nof formula TOML files. The template system (outputPrimeContext) is the correct\npath forward, but the fallback path still has these hardcoded.\n\n### B5: Behavior Policies\n- Pre-sync policy: only \"refinery\" and \"crew\" require git pre-sync (hardcoded switch)\n- Merge conflict policy: \"assign_back\" hardcoded in refinery/engineer.go\n- Restart backoff: initialBackoff=30s, multiplier=2.0, max=10min all hardcoded\n- Doctor production DB list: [\"hq\",\"beads\",\"gastown\",\"sky\",\"wyvern\",\"beads_hop\"] hardcoded\n\n### B6: Help Assessment Heuristics (witness/protocol.go)\nKeyword-based escalation rules (\"conflict\" → escalate, \"test fail\" → escalate)\nare hardcoded string matching. These are policies that should be configurable.\n\n## Gap Category C: Formula Features Used But Underutilized\n\n### C1: Variable System\nThe formula var system ({{var}}) with validation exists and works, but only\nmol-polecat-work uses it significantly ({{issue}}, {{base_branch}}, etc.).\nMost workflow formulas have no vars at all, relying on step descriptions\nbeing interpreted by agents at runtime.\n\n### C2: Acceptance Criteria\nThe Step.Acceptance field exists for Ralph loop mode but is only used in\nthe shiny formula and its extensions. Patrol formulas don't use it — could\nimprove patrol step validation.\n\n### C3: Parallel Steps\nStep.Parallel flag exists but is only used in mol-gastown-boot (via the\nunparsed [[steps.children]] syntax). The core parallel execution logic\nexists in ReadySteps/ParallelReadySteps but isn't exercised by most formulas.\n\n## Recommendations (Priority Order)\n\n1. **HIGH: Audit unparsed TOML features** — Determine if bd handles extends/\n   compose/advice/squash/presets/gate, or if these are truly dead. If dead,\n   either implement parsing or remove the TOML sections to prevent confusion.\n\n2. **HIGH: Unify GUPP threshold** — 30-minute threshold defined independently\n   in 3 files. Should be a single constant or formula var.\n\n3. **MEDIUM: Role registry** — Extract role taxonomy into a declarative\n   registry (could be a formula or config) to eliminate 15+ switch blocks.\n\n4. **MEDIUM: Operational thresholds formula** — Create a config/formula for\n   operational thresholds (timeouts, intervals, pool sizes) so they're\n   tunable without recompilation.\n\n5. **LOW: Patrol molecule metadata** — Add role→patrol-formula association\n   to the role registry instead of hardcoding strings in 5+ files.\n\n6. **LOW: Behavior policies** — Move pre-sync, merge-conflict, restart-backoff\n   policies to configuration.","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-8ta7","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Review complete.

Check: correct --root-only flag usage, formula attachment logic, beadFieldUpdates correctness, no regressions in sling dispatch flow.","design":"## Code Review: b8f79dc8 — root-only wisps for formula-based work\n\n**Reviewer:** furiosa | **Verdict: LGTM — no issues found**\n\n### 1. --root-only flag usage ✅\n- Applied in both formula instantiation paths: `sling_formula.go:152` (standalone) and `sling_helpers.go:InstantiateFormulaOnBead()` (formula-on-bead)\n- Both add `--root-only` before `--json` in `bd mol wisp` args\n- Ensures all paths create only root wisp, no child step wisps\n\n### 2. Formula attachment logic ✅\n- `AttachedFormula` field added to `beads.AttachmentFields` struct\n- Parsing handles 3 variants (attached_formula/attached-formula/attachedformula) — consistent with existing patterns\n- Formatting, SetAttachmentFields known-fields map both updated correctly\n\n### 3. beadFieldUpdates correctness ✅\n- **sling.go:872**: Sets both AttachedMolecule + AttachedFormula — correct (hook bead has separate wisp)\n- **sling_dispatch.go:308**: Same pattern via params.FormulaName — correct\n- **sling_formula.go:196-199**: Sets ONLY AttachedFormula, omits AttachedMolecule — correct and well-documented (wisp IS the root, self-reference meaningless)\n- `storeFieldsInBead()`: empty-check guard pattern matches existing fields\n\n### 4. No regressions in sling dispatch flow ✅\n- Changes purely additive — no fields removed/reordered\n- Legacy fallback preserved in prime output for beads without AttachedFormula\n\n### 5. Prime output changes ✅\n- `outputAutonomousDirective`: molecule → formula language update\n- `outputMoleculeWorkflow`: branches on AttachedFormula → showFormulaStepsFull() (new), else legacy showMoleculeExecutionPrompt()\n- `outputAttachmentStatus`: same branching pattern\n- `showPatrolFormulaSteps` → `showFormulaSteps`: clean generalization with label param\n- New `showFormulaStepsFull`: renders full step descriptions for work formulas\n\n### 6. Dead code removal ✅\n- `parseMoleculeMetadata()`, `showMoleculeProgress()`: removed (only used for child-step tracking)\n- `outputMoleculeContext()` body gutted for polecats (stub remains — patrol roles dispatch to own functions)\n- `beads` import correctly removed from prime_molecule.go\n- Build verified clean: `go build ./...` passes\n\n### 7. Companion docs commit (470b653e) ✅\n- All role templates (polecat, deacon, witness, refinery) updated\n- Concepts docs and reference updated to match new architecture\n\n### Build verification\n`go build ./...` passes with no errors or warnings.\n\n### Summary\nWell-structured change. The two-path design (formula-on-bead vs standalone-formula) correctly handles AttachedFormula in each context. Legacy fallback ensures backward compat for pre-existing beads. Dead code removal is safe — no orphaned functions or imports. Impact claim of ~15x wisp reduction is architecturally sound (10 child wisps eliminated per polecat sling).","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-8v0f","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Review complete.

Hardcoded thresholds, string matching on output, Go code that should be agent judgment. File beads for each issue found.","design":"# ZFC Code Review: session/daemon/boot\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n56 ZFC violations found across three packages. The daemon is the worst offender with 38 violations, having evolved far beyond its \"dumb transport\" mandate into an intelligent controller.\n\n## Findings by Package\n\n### internal/session/ — 7 violations (3 medium, 4 low)\n**Assessment: Relatively ZFC-compliant.** Most violations are in bootstrap-only paths where Go must observe because no agent is running yet.\n\nKey issues:\n- **startup.go:96-113** (MEDIUM): Topic string matching decides what instructions to inject into agent prompts\n- **lifecycle.go:359** (MEDIUM): IsAgentAlive liveness check from PID/process signals\n- **lifecycle.go:233-235** (MEDIUM): AcceptStartupDialogs string-matches pane output (\"trust this folder\", \"Bypass Permissions mode\")\n- **lifecycle.go/town.go** (LOW): Hardcoded timeouts (ClaudeStartTimeout=60s, GracefulShutdownTimeout=3s)\n- **pidtrack.go** (LOW): PID-based state inference (defense-in-depth, documented as best-effort)\n\n### internal/daemon/ — 38 violations (12 high, 18 medium, 8 low)\n**Assessment: Major ZFC violator.** The daemon has become an intelligent controller.\n\nHIGH severity (12):\n- **doctor_dog.go:27-43,539-584**: Automated responses based on hardcoded thresholds (latency\u003e5s→escalate, orphans\u003e20→janitor, backup\u003e1hr→sync)\n- **doctor_dog.go:328-401**: Zombie detection via PID + command line string matching (pgrep -f \"dolt sql-server\", port pattern matching)\n- **daemon.go:1556-1568**: isGasTownDaemon infers identity from ps command output string matching\n- **dolt.go:339-351**: isDoltSqlServer same pattern — ps + strings.Contains\n- **handler.go:16-32,86-182**: Dog lifecycle decisions with hardcoded timeouts (1hr idle→kill session, 4hr idle→remove, 2hr working→\"stuck\")\n- **dolt_remotes.go:107-112**: Refuses to push databases matching test prefixes (string matching policy)\n- **restart_tracker.go:33-40**: Full crash-loop detection with hardcoded backoff (5 restarts in 15min = crash loop)\n- **daemon.go:1034-1043**: Heartbeat staleness \u003e10min → auto-restart Deacon\n- **daemon.go:1088-1095,1140-1147**: Hung session detection with hardcoded 30min threshold → auto-kill\n- **lifecycle.go:907,1048**: GUPP violation detection with hardcoded 30min timeout\n- **daemon.go:118-121**: Mass death detection (3 deaths in 30s = mass death)\n- **daemon.go:1772-1787**: Spawning guard — 5min stale spawning state = failed\n\nMEDIUM severity (18): String matching on output (dog_molecule step discovery, parseWispID, Dolt backup parsing, lifecycle identity parsing, isReadOnlyError), hardcoded policy (test pollution regex patterns, scrub WHERE clause, spike detection 20% threshold, consecutive failure escalation at 3, wisp alert at 500, compactor at 10000 commits, Dolt connection count 50/80%, backup stale 2hr, latency 1s, DB count buffer +3)\n\n### internal/boot/ (+ internal/cmd/boot.go) — 11 violations (3 high, 4 medium, 4 low)\n**Assessment: Split personality.** boot.go itself is clean, but cmd/boot.go implements a full Go decision engine.\n\nHIGH severity (3):\n- **cmd/boot.go:24**: Hardcoded 30min deaconRestartThreshold\n- **cmd/boot.go:282-381**: runDegradedTriage — full multi-level decision tree in Go (missing→start, very stale+\u003e30m→kill, stale→nudge, fresh+backoff→skip, no hook→nudge idle, hook+stale 15m→nudge)\n- **cmd/boot.go:372**: Hardcoded 15min molecule staleness threshold\n\nMEDIUM severity (4):\n- **cmd/boot.go:387-409**: isDeaconInBackoff — string-match bead labels (\"idle:\") to infer state\n- **cmd/boot.go:413-436**: getDeaconHookBead — query bead slots in Go to determine activity\n- **cmd/boot.go:443-476**: getMoleculeLastActivity — parse molecule steps in Go to assess progress\n- **deacon/heartbeat.go:14-21**: Hardcoded staleness thresholds (5min stale, 15min very stale)\n\n**Structural issue**: `gt boot triage` always runs runDegradedTriage regardless of --degraded flag, so even when Boot agent runs `gt boot triage`, all intelligence is in Go, making the agent a thin wrapper.\n\n## Core Architectural Issue\n\nThe daemon has evolved far beyond \"pokes the deacon, nothing more.\" It now:\n- Runs health monitoring with automated responses (doctor_dog)\n- Makes kill/restart decisions based on inferred session state\n- Implements crash-loop detection with exponential backoff\n- Detects and filters \"test pollution\" using regex patterns\n- Implements anomaly detection (spike detection) with hardcoded thresholds\n- Manages dog lifecycle with hardcoded timeouts\n- Parses process command lines to infer identity\n- Makes GUPP violation judgments\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Daemon**: Extract all decision-making into agent-observable reports. Daemon collects metrics; agents decide actions.\n2. **Boot**: Make `gt boot triage` emit observations, not decisions. Let the Boot agent interpret and decide.\n3. **Session**: Bootstrap exceptions are acceptable (no agent to delegate to), but document the boundary explicitly.\n4. **Thresholds**: Move all hardcoded thresholds to configuration (beads or config files).","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-bylf","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Code review: session/daemon/boot for ZFC violations","updated_at":"2026-02-28T02:54:39Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Preserves human as git author (CV credit flows correctly)\n2. Agent attribution via Co-Authored-By (grep-able for `gt trail`)\n3. Aligns with existing Claude Code Co-Authored-By pattern\n4. Model attribution remains (already in use)\n\n## Agent Email Convention\n\nFor the Co-Authored-By email, use pattern:\n```\n{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local\n\nExamples:\n- jack@crew.gastown.local           # Crew member jack on rig gastown\n- toast@polecats.beads.gastown.local # Polecat toast on rig beads\n- witness@gastown.gastown.local     # Witness on rig gastown (no name)\n- refinery@beads.gastown.local      # Refinery on rig beads\n- mayor@hq.gastown.local            # Mayor (town-level, use \"hq\" as pseudo-rig)\n- deacon@hq.gastown.local           # Deacon (town-level)\n```\n\nPattern breakdown: `{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local`\n- Name: Agent name (or role name if singleton like witness)\n- Role: crew, polecats, witness, refinery, mayor, deacon\n- Rig: The rig name (or \"hq\" for town-level agents)\n- Domain: `gastown.local` (non-routable, clearly synthetic)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Set agent git identity at spawn time\n\nIn `gt crew spawn` and `gt polecat spawn`:\n```bash\ngit config user.name \"{name} ({role})\"\ngit config user.email \"{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local\"\n```\n\nBut this would make agent the primary author. Instead:\n\n### 2. Use commit hooks or templates\n\nOption A: Commit message template that includes Co-Authored-By\nOption B: Git commit hook that appends Co-Authored-By\nOption C: Agent's commit wrapper adds the line\n\nRecommended: Option C - agents use a `gt commit` wrapper that:\n1. Uses human's git config for author\n2. Appends agent Co-Authored-By line\n3. Appends model Co-Authored-By line (if not present)\n\n### 3. For gt trail: Parse commits\n\n```go\nfunc GetAgentCommits(agentID string) []Commit {\n    // Convert agent ID to email pattern\n    // gastown/crew/jack -\u003e jack@crew.gastown.gastown.local\n    email := AgentIDToEmail(agentID)\n\n    // Search commits for Co-Authored-By matching email\n    return git.LogWithCoAuthor(email)\n}\n```\n\n## How gt trail Uses This\n\n```\ngt trail commits\n```\n\n1. Get current agent identity via `GetRole()` -\u003e `gastown/crew/jack`\n2. Convert to email pattern: `jack@crew.gastown.gastown.local`\n3. Search git log for commits with matching Co-Authored-By\n4. Display results\n\n## Beads Already Handle This\n\nBeads have `created_by` field with agent identity - no change needed there.\n\n## Open Question\n\nShould there be a `gt commit` wrapper, or should this be done via:\n- Git hooks installed by `gt init`?\n- Environment setup at agent spawn?\n- Claude Code configuration?\n\nRecommendation: Git hooks installed per-agent that append the Co-Authored-By line.\n\n## Related\n\n- Blocks: gt-j1m5v (gt trail design)\n- Aligns with: FEDERATION.md identity hierarchy\n- Aligns with: BEADS-SCHEMA-CHANGES.md owner vs created_by\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-f6mkz","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Agent git identity: Co-Authored-By convention","updated_at":"2026-02-27T02:56:05Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Show most recent sync time and count of DB dirs.\n   - JSONL: Check the JSONL git archive repo for last commit time. The archive is at `~/gt/.beads/` (the git repo with .jsonl files). Use `git -C \u003cpath\u003e log -1 --format=%ci` to get last push time.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- New file: `internal/cmd/vitals.go`\n- Register as `gt vitals` subcommand\n- No flags needed for v1 (maybe --json later)\n- Thin command: calls existing internal APIs (doltserver health, bd stats, ps, file stat)\n- Use the same terminal formatting as gt status (colors, bullets)\n\n## Anti-patterns to avoid\n\n- Do NOT over-engineer this. No config files, no historical tracking, no database storage.\n- Keep it under 200 lines of Go.\n- Shell out to existing tools where convenient (ps, git log, bd stats) rather than reimplementing their logic.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-fubw","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"gt vitals: unified health dashboard command","updated_at":"2026-02-27T08:26:50Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Current state:\n- Hooks manually copied to each settings.json\n- No central registry of available hooks\n- No tooling to reconcile reality vs desired state\n- Shell script hooks (like Joe's) not integrated with gt tap\n\n## Critical Discovery: Claude Code Settings Model\n\n**Claude Code does NOT traverse parent directories.** It only looks in CWD.\n\n### Precedence (highest → lowest)\n1. Enterprise Managed Policy (managed-settings.json) - cannot override\n2. CLI flags\n3. .claude/settings.local.json (personal, gitignored)\n4. .claude/settings.json (project, committed)\n5. ~/.claude/settings.json (user global)\n6. Built-in defaults\n\n### Merging Behavior\n- Arrays (hooks): MERGE across all levels\n- Scalars: Override (higher precedence wins)\n\n### The Monorepo Problem\n```\n~/gt/                           ← No .claude/ here\n├── gastown/\n│   └── mayor/\n│       └── .claude/settings.json   ← Only found if CWD is here\n├── beads/\n│   └── .claude/settings.json       ← Only found if CWD is here\n```\n\nIf CWD is `gastown/mayor/rig` (below .claude), hooks WON'T be found.\n\n### Current Workaround\nSettings files at multiple levels, each worktree gets its own copy.\nThis works because agents start in their designated worktree root.\n\n## Design Requirements\n\n### 1. Hook Registry\nCentral definition of available hooks:\n```yaml\nhooks:\n  guards:\n    pr-workflow:\n      command: gt tap guard pr-workflow\n      matchers:\n        - Bash(gh pr create*)\n        - Bash(git checkout -b*)\n        - Bash(git switch -c*)\n      default: enabled\n      scope: [crew, polecats]\n    \n    force-push:\n      command: gt tap guard force-push\n      matchers: [Bash(*push*--force*)]\n      default: enabled\n      scope: [all]\n\n  audits:\n    git-push:\n      command: gt tap audit git-push\n      hook_type: PostToolUse\n      matchers: [Bash(git push*)]\n```\n\n### 2. Tooling\n- `gt crew add \u003cname\u003e` - sets up worktree WITH correct hooks\n- `gt doctor hooks` - reconcile reality vs registry\n- `gt tap list` - show available hooks\n- `gt tap enable/disable \u003chook\u003e` - per-worktree control\n\n### 3. Private vs Public Hooks\n- settings.json (committed) - team-wide hooks\n- settings.local.json (gitignored) - personal overrides\n- How to handle \"disable this hook for me\"?\n\n### 4. Hook Ordering\nIf multiple hooks match same pattern, what order do they fire?\nClaude merges arrays - need to understand/control order.\n\n### 5. Shell Script Hooks\nJoe's hook is a shell script, not a gt command.\nOptions:\n- Keep both patterns (gt tap AND raw scripts)\n- Wrap scripts: `gt tap run \u003cscript-name\u003e`\n- Registry includes both types\n\n### 6. Feature Request Tracking\nClaude Code #12962: parent directory traversal (like .gitignore)\nUntil that ships, we need the workaround.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where does the registry live? (gt config? dedicated file?)\n2. How to version/migrate hook configs when registry changes?\n3. Per-worktree disable vs global disable?\n4. Should gt tap commands be standalone or require registry?\n\n## Related\n- ~/gt/docs/HOOKS.md - current hook documentation\n- gt tap guard pr-workflow - first implemented hook\n- Claude Code hooks docs","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-gow8b","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Design: Claude Code hooks registry and management","updated_at":"2026-02-26T23:29:28Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

'alpha' appears only in doc comments (types.go:22) and test fixtures. 'boot' appears in one explanatory comment (manager.go:300).\n\n2. **Specific dog type checks**: NONE. No Type/Kind field exists on Dog struct. No name-based switch/case/if branching anywhere in the package.\n\n3. **Hardcoded plugin names**: NONE. The dog package has zero awareness of plugins, formulas, or what any dog does.\n\n4. **Go code deciding dog behavior**: NONE in internal/dog/. The package is purely infrastructure — lifecycle, state, sessions, health. All behavior differentiation happens outside:\n   - internal/daemon/{doctor,compactor,janitor}_dog.go (imperative Go for critical dogs)\n   - Plugin system (formula dispatch for non-critical dogs)\n\n### Minor Notes\n- generateDogName() in sling_dog.go uses hardcoded NATO phonetic names for auto-naming, but this is naming convention only, not behavior branching.\n- The daemon package's imperative dog implementations (Doctor, Reaper, Compactor) are a deliberate architecture choice documented in docs/design/dog-execution-model.md, not a ZFC violation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe internal/dog/ package follows ZFC principles well — dogs are generic workers whose behavior is determined by their formula/plugin assignment, not by hardcoded Go logic in this package.","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Code review: dog package for hardcoded dog names/types","updated_at":"2026-02-28T02:54:10Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Instead:\n- One polecat SESSION per molecule STEP\n- Same sandbox (branch/worktree) persists across sessions\n- Each step: spawn → work → close bead → recycle session\n- Final step: spawn → work → close bead → signal complete → merge → nuke sandbox\n\n## Two Cleanup Stages\n\n| Stage | Trigger | Kills | Survives |\n|-------|---------|-------|----------|\n| Step cleanup | Step bead closed | Session | Branch, worktree, molecule |\n| Molecule cleanup | Merged | Session, branch, worktree | Digest |\n\n## Per-Rig Polecat Channel\n\nNeed a mailing list/queue per rig for session-lifecycle requests:\n- \"Recycle me\" (from polecat)\n- \"Recycle worker X\" (from witness/mayor)\n- \"Spawn for step Y\" (from anyone)\n\nFirst-come-first-served by patrolling agents. Anyone on patrol (Witness, Refinery, Crew, Mayor) can service requests.\n\n## GUPP + Pinned Work = Completion\n\nAs long as:\n1. Work is pinned to polecat identity (e.g., gastown/furiosa)\n2. Sandbox persists (branch + worktree)\n3. Someone keeps spawning polecat when it dies\n\n→ The molecule WILL get finished. GUPP ensures wake-and-work.\n\n## Daemon → Deacon Heartbeat\n\nThe daemon pings the deacon, keeping the cycle alive. Deacon peeks into rig-wide channels during patrol and can service lifecycle requests.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n### Q1: Spoon-Feeding Bin-Packing\nTwo dimensions of granularity trade-offs:\n- How many logical steps per physical molecule step?\n- How many molecule steps per polecat session?\n\nToo few steps → context exhaustion, forgetting\nToo many steps → overhead, fragmentation\n\nNeeds: Analysis of optimal granularity based on step complexity.\n\n### Q2: Mechanical vs Agent-Driven Recycling\nCaution from deacon murder spree bug: mechanical detection of \"stuck\" workers is fragile.\n\nPrefer: Explicit \"recycle me\" requests serviced by patrol agents.\n\nQuestion: When is mechanical intervention appropriate?\n\n### Q3: Channel Implementation\nOptions:\n- Mail-based (gt mail to rig/polecats)\n- Beads-based (special issue type)\n- State file (rig/polecat-queue.json)\n\nMail seems most consistent with Gas Town patterns.\n\n### Q4: Who Spawns Next Step?\nCurrent: gt sling spawns fresh polecat\nNeeded: Mechanism for \"continue molecule on existing sandbox\"\n\nMaybe: gt sling --continue or witness detects pending step.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-dtw9u: Witness monitoring (enhance survey-workers)\n- gt-qpwv4: Completion detection (check ready branches)\n- gt-6qyt1: Refinery queue (process MERGE_READY)\n- gt-budeb: Auto-nuke (handle MERGED signal)\n- gt-5j3ia: Swarm aggregation (batch completion)\n- gt-1dbcp: Polecat auto-start (SessionStart hook issue)\n\n## Design Principles (from HOP/MEOW context)\n\n1. **Discovery over tracking** - observe reality each cycle\n2. **Mail as coordination primitive** - agents signal via mail\n3. **ZFC** - Claude makes judgment calls, no hardcoded thresholds\n4. **Redundant monitoring** - overlapping observation is resilience\n5. **Wisps are ephemeral** - patrol molecules flow like water\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Look for multi-table joins, nested subqueries, large result sets without LIMIT.","design":"# SQL Query Audit: Expensive Patterns in gastown + beads/store.go\n\n## CRITICAL — Must Fix (High Risk of Dolt Memory Exhaustion)\n\n### 1. wisp_reaper.go:519-535 — Double NOT IN with INNER JOINs (WORST OFFENDER)\n```sql\nSELECT id, title, updated_at FROM `%s`.issues\nWHERE status IN ('open', 'in_progress')\n  AND updated_at \u003c ?\n  AND priority \u003e 1\n  AND issue_type != 'epic'\n  AND id NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT d.issue_id FROM `%s`.dependencies d\n    INNER JOIN `%s`.issues i ON d.depends_on_id = i.id\n    WHERE i.status IN ('open', 'in_progress')\n  )\n  AND id NOT IN (\n    SELECT DISTINCT d.depends_on_id FROM `%s`.dependencies d\n    INNER JOIN `%s`.issues i ON d.issue_id = i.id\n    WHERE i.status IN ('open', 'in_progress')\n  )\n```\n**Risk**: Two correlated NOT IN subqueries, each with an INNER JOIN. Dolt materializes each subquery fully. With N issues and M dependencies, this is O(N*M) per subquery, run twice. No LIMIT.\n**Fix**: Replace with LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL pattern, or pre-compute dependency sets and filter in Go.\n\n### 2. wisp_reaper.go:413 — Subquery in WHERE (IN SELECT)\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `%s`.issues\nWHERE status = 'closed' AND closed_at \u003c ?\n  AND id IN (SELECT issue_id FROM `%s`.labels WHERE label = 'gt:message')\n```\n**Risk**: Subquery materialized for every row evaluation. Could hang on large issues table.\n**Fix**: Rewrite as INNER JOIN: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues i INNER JOIN labels l ON i.id = l.issue_id WHERE i.status = 'closed' AND i.closed_at \u003c ? AND l.label = 'gt:message'`\n\n### 3. wisps_migrate.go:316,327,337,347 — INNER JOINs without WHERE (bulk migration)\nFour queries all following the same pattern:\n```sql\nINSERT IGNORE INTO wisp_labels (issue_id, label)\nSELECT l.issue_id, l.label FROM labels l INNER JOIN wisps w ON l.issue_id = w.id\n```\n(Same for wisp_comments, wisp_events, wisp_dependencies)\n**Risk**: Full cross-product of labels×wisps (and comments×wisps, events×wisps, deps×wisps). No WHERE clause means all matching rows processed. No LIMIT. Migration runs once, but if wisps table is large, each query processes the entire join.\n**Mitigating factor**: These run only during migration, not in steady state. But could still OOM on large databases.\n**Fix**: Add batching with LIMIT/OFFSET, or add WHERE clause filtering to avoid unnecessary work.\n\n## MODERATE — Should Review\n\n### 4. jsonl_git_backup.go:238 — SELECT * with multiple LIKE patterns\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM `%s`.issues WHERE (ephemeral IS NULL OR ephemeral != 1)\n  AND issue_type NOT IN ('message', 'event', 'agent', 'convoy', 'molecule', 'role', 'merge-request', 'rig')\n  AND id NOT LIKE '%-wisp-%' AND id NOT LIKE '%-cv-%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'test%' AND id NOT LIKE 'beads\\_t%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'beads\\_pt%' AND id NOT LIKE 'doctest\\_%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'offlinebrew-%'\n  AND title NOT LIKE '--%' AND title NOT LIKE 'Usage: %'\n  ORDER BY id\n```\n**Risk**: SELECT * (all columns), 9 LIKE patterns (each requires string comparison), no LIMIT. Full table scan guaranteed. If issues table grows large, this becomes expensive.\n**Mitigating factor**: Runs as daemon backup, not interactive path.\n**Fix**: Add LIMIT with batching for very large tables, or filter by indexed columns first.\n\n### 5. wl_sync.go:99-103 — Four scalar subqueries\n```sql\nSELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wanted WHERE status = 'open') AS open_wanted,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wanted) AS total_wanted,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completions) AS total_completions,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stamps) AS total_stamps\n```\n**Risk**: Four separate COUNT(*) scans in one query. Dolt may not optimize these well.\n**Mitigating factor**: Runs via `dolt sql` CLI, not the shared server. Tables are small (wasteland).\n**Fix**: Low priority since it runs locally, but could use 4 separate queries or UNION.\n\n### 6. compactor_dog.go — ORDER BY on dolt_log\n```sql\nSELECT commit_hash FROM `%s`.dolt_log ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 1  -- root commit\nSELECT commit_hash FROM `%s`.dolt_log ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1 -- HEAD commit\n```\n**Risk**: dolt_log can grow unboundedly with commit history. ORDER BY without index could be expensive.\n**Mitigating factor**: LIMIT 1 helps, and Dolt may optimize dolt_log access. HEAD query likely short-circuits.\n\n### 7. beads/store.go:954-960 — Correlated NOT EXISTS subquery\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM dolt_status s\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1 FROM dolt_ignore di WHERE di.ignored = 1 AND s.table_name LIKE di.pattern\n)\n```\n**Risk**: Correlated subquery with LIKE pattern matching. Runs for each row in dolt_status.\n**Mitigating factor**: dolt_status is tiny (handful of rows). Low risk in practice.\n\n## LOW RISK — Acceptable\n\n- **wisp_reaper.go:430** — JOIN with LIMIT (properly batched, good pattern)\n- **health.go:239** — Dynamic WHERE with LIMIT 10 (bounded result set)\n- **vitals.go:151** — Aggregation with CASE (efficient single-pass pattern)\n- **doltserver.go:2154** — COUNT(*) on PROCESSLIST (system table, tiny)\n- **beads/store.go** — Most queries are simple single-table SELECTs, properly parameterized\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Priority | File | Line | Pattern | Risk |\n|----------|------|------|---------|------|\n| CRITICAL | wisp_reaper.go | 519-535 | 2x NOT IN + INNER JOIN | OOM on large DBs |\n| CRITICAL | wisp_reaper.go | 413 | IN (SELECT subquery) | Hang on large tables |\n| HIGH | wisps_migrate.go | 316,327,337,347 | JOIN without WHERE (×4) | OOM during migration |\n| MEDIUM | jsonl_git_backup.go | 238 | SELECT * + 9 LIKEs, no LIMIT | Slow backup on large DBs |\n| LOW | wl_sync.go | 99-103 | 4 scalar subqueries | Minor, local CLI only |\n| LOW | compactor_dog.go | 135,290,322 | ORDER BY on dolt_log | LIMIT 1 mitigates |\n| LOW | beads/store.go | 954-960 | Correlated NOT EXISTS | dolt_status always tiny |\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Immediate**: Rewrite wisp_reaper.go:519-535 to use LEFT JOIN pattern or pre-filter in Go\n2. **Immediate**: Rewrite wisp_reaper.go:413 to use INNER JOIN instead of IN (SELECT)\n3. **Soon**: Add batching (LIMIT+loop) to wisps_migrate.go bulk INSERT IGNORE queries\n4. **Later**: Add LIMIT+batching to jsonl_git_backup.go backup query for large table resilience","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-u55vt","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Audit complete.

Spawns polecats for each leg (parallel where possible)\n3. Each polecat gets leg-specific prompt + shared context\n4. Outputs collected as bead attachments or slots\n5. Synthesis polecat reads all outputs, produces final deliverable\n6. Convoy lands with unified result\n\n### Dependencies\n- Leg outputs feed synthesis (internal convoy deps)\n- Formula can specify leg ordering if needed\n- Parallel by default, sequential where required\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where do formulas live? Town-level beads? Separate formula registry?\n2. How to version/share formulas across towns?\n3. Leg output format standardization?\n4. Human checkpoints between legs or only at end?\n5. Partial formula runs (skip some legs)?\n6. Formula composition (formula that includes other formulas)?\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGas Town currently waits for humans to create work. With formulas:\n- Mayor can invoke structured reviews on any PR\n- Design work follows consistent methodology\n- Quality processes are repeatable and scalable\n- Work generation becomes as automated as work execution\n\n**Guzzoline factory, not just guzzoline consumer.**","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-ubqeg","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"in_progress","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Formula Molecules: Guzzoline production for Gas Town","updated_at":"2026-01-21T05:30:17Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

New code ignores role beads entirely (reads from config)\n2. Old role beads become orphaned (harmless)\n3. Users can optionally run `bd close hq-*-role` to clean up\n4. Or just leave them (they're inert)\n\nNo data migration required. The config system is additive.\n\n### What Stays the Same\n\n- Agent beads (`hq-deacon`, `gt-gastown-witness`) - Still store runtime state\n- System prompt templates (`internal/templates/roles/*.md.tmpl`) - Unchanged\n- `settings.json` role_agents - Model selection stays in settings\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **No migration needed** - Config ships with binary\n2. **Clear separation** - Config (how roles work) vs. ledger (work evidence)\n3. **Easy customization** - Edit YAML, not beads\n4. **Versioned with code** - Role defs evolve with releases\n5. **Discoverable** - `gt role show deacon` vs. `bd show hq-deacon-role`\n6. **Aligns with HOP** - Beads are for work, not infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Add config system (non-breaking)\n- [ ] Create `internal/config/roles.go` with types\n- [ ] Create embedded default YAML files\n- [ ] Add `LoadRoleConfig()` function\n- [ ] Add `gt role show` and `gt role list` commands\n\n### Phase 2: Switch daemon to config\n- [ ] Update `daemon/lifecycle.go` to use `LoadRoleConfig()`\n- [ ] Update `getRoleConfigForIdentity()` to use new loader\n- [ ] Test all role types still work\n\n### Phase 3: Clean up role beads\n- [ ] Remove role bead creation from `gt install`\n- [ ] Remove `gt migrate-agents` command\n- [ ] Update `gt doctor` to check config instead of role beads\n- [ ] Remove `role_bead` field from agent bead schema\n- [ ] Mark `beads_role.go` as deprecated (or remove)\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation\n- [ ] Update architecture.md\n- [ ] Add role customization docs\n- [ ] Update PRIMING.md if needed\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Should defaults be written to disk?** Current design embeds in binary. Alternative: `gt install` writes `roles/defaults/` as reference copies.\n\n2. **Rig-level role overrides path?** Currently `\u003crig\u003e/roles/`. Could also be `\u003crig\u003e/config/roles/` for consistency.\n\n3. **Role inheritance?** Should `crew` be able to inherit from `polecat` with overrides? (Probably not - keep it simple.)\n\n## References\n\n- PRIMING.md - Two-level beads architecture\n- architecture.md - Agent bead storage\n- 001-beads-is-the-ledger.md - Beads as work ledger, not config store\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-y1uvb","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Replace role beads with config-based role system","updated_at":"2026-02-27T02:56:07Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

It processes one MR at a time: build → test → merge → push, sequentially. At swarm scale (8+ polecats), MRs queue up and branches go stale waiting. The refinery runs full test suites itself, blocking the merge queue for minutes per MR.\n\nDESIRED STATE: The refinery becomes a lightweight coordinator. Expensive work (build, test, lint, review) is parallelized across helpers or done by the polecats themselves before submission.\n\nDESIGN INVESTIGATION:\n1. **Refinery helpers (Dog-like pattern)**: The Deacon offloads work to Dogs. Can the refinery spawn short-lived helpers to run build/test/review in parallel? Multiple MRs verified concurrently, refinery just does the final fast-forward merge.\n\n2. **Polecat-owned rebasing**: Polecats rebase onto main, run tests, and only submit when green. The refinery's job shrinks to: verify the branch is rebased, fast-forward merge, push. If main moved, polecat retries (optimistic concurrency — like real CI). This is the 'polecats fight over rebasing' model.\n\n3. **Review plugins as polecats**: Instead of the refinery running review plugins inline, dispatch them as polecat tasks. Code review, security scan, style check — all run concurrently by different polecats, results written to beads. Refinery reads the verdict.\n\n4. **Merge queue ordering**: With parallel verification, how does the refinery decide merge order? First-green-wins? Priority-based? Dependency-aware?\n\n5. **Interaction with witness decoupling (gt-0wkk)**: If polecats self-manage completion AND self-manage rebasing, what's left for the refinery? Just the atomic merge+push?\n\nDELIVERABLE: Design doc with proposed architecture, migration path, and tradeoffs. Not code.\n\nCONTEXT: 50 convoys currently piled up. Refinery processing one MR at a time. Both gastown and beads refineries are spending minutes on test suites per MR.","design":"# Refinery Parallel Merge Pipeline — Design Document\n\n## Status: PROPOSED\n## Author: polecat/slit\n## Issue: gt-yxx0\n\n---\n\n## 1. Problem Statement\n\nThe Refinery is a single-threaded bottleneck. It processes one MR at a time:\nclaim, rebase, setup, typecheck, lint, build, test, merge, push — sequentially.\n\nAt swarm scale (8+ polecats), MRs queue up and branches go stale waiting.\nCurrent throughput: ~4 MRs/hour (at 15min test suites). Target: 15-20+ MRs/hour.\n\nCurrent bottleneck breakdown (per MR):\n- Rebase: ~5s\n- Setup (pnpm install, etc.): ~30s\n- Typecheck: ~30s\n- Lint: ~20s\n- Build: ~60s\n- Tests: 5-15 min (DOMINANT COST)\n- Merge + push: ~5s\n\n## 2. Proposed Architecture: Batched Merge Queue\n\n### 2.1 Core Design: Batch-then-Bisect (Bors Pattern)\n\nReplace sequential per-MR testing with batched verification:\n\nCURRENT (sequential):\n  MR1: rebase then test then merge then push\n  MR2: rebase then test then merge then push  (waits for MR1)\n  MR3: rebase then test then merge then push  (waits for MR2)\n  Total: 3 x test_time\n\nPROPOSED (batched):\n  Batch [MR1, MR2, MR3]:\n    1. Rebase MR1 onto main\n    2. Rebase MR2 onto MR1\n    3. Rebase MR3 onto MR2 (this is the \"stack tip\")\n    4. Run tests ONCE on the stack tip\n    5. If pass: fast-forward merge all 3\n    6. If fail: bisect to find culprit\n  Total: 1 x test_time (happy path)\n\n### 2.2 Batch Formation\n\nConfig knobs (new fields on MergeQueueConfig):\n\n    MaxBatchSize int           // Default: 5. Larger = more throughput,\n                               // bisection cost grows O(log N).\n    BatchWaitTime time.Duration // Default: 30s. Wait for batch to fill.\n                               // 0 = process immediately.\n    MaxParallelBatches int     // Default: 1 (no speculation).\n                               // 2-3 for high throughput.\n\nBatch assembly algorithm:\n1. Poll queue for open MRs, sorted by score (existing scoring logic)\n2. Take up to MaxBatchSize MRs from the head of the queue\n3. If queue has fewer MRs than MaxBatchSize and BatchWaitTime \u003e 0,\n   wait for more MRs to arrive (up to BatchWaitTime)\n4. Claim all MRs in the batch atomically\n5. Build the rebase stack (see 2.3)\n\n### 2.3 Rebase Stack Construction\n\nThe stack is built bottom-up. Each MR in the batch is rebased onto the\nresult of all preceding MRs:\n\n    main \u003c- MR1 \u003c- MR2 \u003c- MR3 (stack tip)\n\nImplementation:\n    buildStack(ctx, batch []MR, targetBranch) -\u003e (tipSHA, error):\n        stackBranch = \"refinery/batch/\u003cbatchID\u003e\"\n        git checkout -b stackBranch origin/targetBranch\n\n        for each mr in batch:\n            err = git rebase mr.Branch onto stackBranch\n            if err (conflict):\n                return ConflictError{MR: mr}\n            // Stack branch now includes this MR's changes\n\n        return git rev-parse HEAD\n\nConflict during stack build:\n- If MR[i] conflicts during rebase, remove it from the batch\n- Assign conflict back to worker (existing flow)\n- Rebuild stack without MR[i] (remaining MRs may now be conflict-free)\n- File conflict-resolution task as today\n\n### 2.4 Test-on-Tip Verification\n\nRun the full gate suite (typecheck, lint, build, test) on the stack tip.\nThe tip SHA incorporates ALL MR changes, so a green result proves the batch\nis safe to merge.\n\n    verifyBatch(ctx, stackBranch, config) -\u003e BatchResult:\n        result = runGates(ctx)  // Existing gate infrastructure\n        if result.Success:\n            return BatchPassed\n        else:\n            return BatchFailed{GateResults: result.Details}\n\n### 2.5 Fast-Forward Merge (Happy Path)\n\nWhen tests pass on the stack tip:\n1. Acquire merge slot (existing mechanism)\n2. Verify target branch hasn't moved since stack was built\n   - If moved: rebuild stack from new target, re-test (retry)\n   - If same: proceed to merge\n3. git merge --ff-only stackBranch  (fast-forward target to stack tip)\n4. git push origin targetBranch\n5. Close all MR beads in batch (reason: merged)\n6. Close all source issues\n7. Delete merged branches\n8. Release merge slot\n\nWhy fast-forward: The stack tip SHA is exactly what was tested. No merge\ncommit is created, so what lands is bit-for-bit what CI verified. This is\nthe \"Not Rocket Science Rule\" from bors.\n\n### 2.6 Bisection (Failure Path)\n\nWhen tests fail on the stack tip, bisect to find the culprit:\n\n    bisectBatch(ctx, batch []MR, target) -\u003e culprits []MR:\n        if len(batch) == 1:\n            return batch  // Single MR failed — it's the culprit\n\n        mid = len(batch) / 2\n        left = batch[:mid]\n        right = batch[mid:]\n\n        leftStack = buildStack(ctx, left, target)\n        leftResult = verifyBatch(ctx, leftStack)\n\n        if leftResult.Failed:\n            return bisectBatch(ctx, left, target)\n\n        // Left half is green — culprit is in right half\n        // Test right in context of left (cumulative merge)\n        // O(log N) test runs to isolate culprit\n\nBisection strategy:\n- Binary search: O(log N) test runs to find the bad MR\n- For batch of 5: worst case 3 test runs (vs 5 sequential)\n- Culprit MR gets assigned back to worker (existing flow)\n- Remaining good MRs get re-batched in next cycle\n\nOptimization — parallel bisection:\nWhen bisecting, test both halves concurrently. The failing half gets\nfurther bisected while the passing half gets merged immediately.\nTrade-off: 2x CI capacity usage during bisection for 2x faster isolation.\n\n## 3. Polecat-Owned Pre-Verification\n\n### 3.1 Shift-Left: Polecats Run Gates Before Submission\n\nCurrently, polecats run tests on their feature branch (step 6 of\nmol-polecat-work). The Refinery then re-runs the same tests after rebase.\nThis is redundant when no conflicts exist.\n\nProposed change to mol-polecat-work formula — add step 6.5:\n\n    Step 6.5: Pre-merge rebase verification\n      1. Fetch latest target branch\n      2. Rebase feature branch onto target\n      3. Run full gate suite on rebased result\n      4. If pass: submit MR with \"pre-verified\" flag\n      5. If fail (conflict): resolve and retry\n      6. If fail (tests): fix and retry\n\nMR metadata (new struct embedded in MR bead):\n\n    type MRPreVerification struct {\n        Verified     bool        // polecat ran gates after rebase\n        VerifiedAt   time.Time   // when verification completed\n        VerifiedBase string      // target branch SHA at verification time\n        GateResults  []GateResult // individual gate outcomes\n    }\n\n### 3.2 Refinery Fast Path for Pre-Verified MRs\n\nWhen the Refinery encounters a pre-verified MR whose VerifiedBase\nmatches the current target HEAD:\n- Skip all gates (typecheck, lint, build, test)\n- Just fast-forward merge and push\n- This reduces Refinery processing to ~5 seconds per MR\n\nWhen VerifiedBase doesn't match (main moved):\n- The polecat's verification is stale\n- Refinery must re-verify OR assign back for re-verification\n- Decision: if the only changes to main since VerifiedBase are from\n  OTHER batched MRs that passed, the pre-verification is still valid\n  (transitive trust). Only re-verify if an external push landed on main.\n\n### 3.3 Optimistic Concurrency: \"Polecats Fight Over Rebasing\"\n\nFor maximum throughput, multiple polecats can speculatively rebase and\nverify concurrently:\n\n    Polecat A: fetch main -\u003e rebase -\u003e test -\u003e submit (verified_base=abc)\n    Polecat B: fetch main -\u003e rebase -\u003e test -\u003e submit (verified_base=abc)\n    Polecat C: fetch main -\u003e rebase -\u003e test -\u003e submit (verified_base=abc)\n\n    Refinery: A arrives first, verified_base=abc matches -\u003e merge -\u003e main=def\n              B arrives, verified_base=abc != def -\u003e STALE\n              C arrives, verified_base=abc != def -\u003e STALE\n\nB and C wasted their test runs. This is the OCC waste problem.\n\nMitigation: The Refinery batching subsumes this. Polecats pre-verify\nagainst the target they know. The Refinery then batches all pre-verified\nMRs, does a quick stack-build (no conflict = no re-test needed thanks to\npre-verification), and fast-forward merges the batch. Only if conflicts\narise during stack-build does re-testing become necessary.\n\n## 4. Review Plugins as Parallel Tasks\n\n### 4.1 Current State\n\nThe Refinery runs review plugins inline during MR processing. This adds\nlatency to the critical path.\n\n### 4.2 Proposed: Decouple Review from Merge\n\n    MR submitted -\u003e Dispatcher\n                        |\n           +------------+------------+\n           v            v            v\n      Review       Security      Style\n      Polecat      Scanner       Checker\n           |            |            |\n           v            v            v\n      Verdicts (written to beads)\n                        |\n                        v\n                   Refinery (reads verdicts, merges if all pass)\n\nImplementation:\n- On MR submission, dispatch review tasks as separate beads\n- Each review task is handled by a short-lived polecat (or dog)\n- Review polecats write verdicts to the MR bead (pass/fail + notes)\n- Refinery waits for all verdicts before proceeding to merge\n- Reviews run concurrently with each other AND with test verification\n\nBenefits:\n- Reviews don't block the merge queue\n- Multiple reviews run in parallel\n- Expensive reviews (AI code review) don't delay simple merges\n- Reviews are recorded as beads (audit trail)\n\nTrade-off: More agent spawns = more resource usage. For simple\nprojects, inline review may be faster than spawn overhead.\n\nConfig (new struct):\n\n    type ReviewConfig struct {\n        Plugins        []ReviewPlugin // review plugins to run\n        RequireAllPass bool           // all must pass before merge (default true)\n        Timeout        time.Duration  // max wait for all reviews\n    }\n\n## 5. Merge Queue Ordering with Parallel Verification\n\n### 5.1 Ordering Strategy: Priority-Scored FIFO with Batching\n\nThe existing ScoreMR function already provides good ordering. With batching,\nthe batch is assembled from the highest-scored MRs in the queue.\n\nWithin a batch: Order matters for the rebase stack. Higher-priority MRs\ngo first (bottom of stack) so they merge even if later MRs in the batch\nfail during bisection.\n\nCross-batch (speculative execution, Phase 4): If MaxParallelBatches \u003e 1:\n- Batch 1: MRs [1,2,3] — verified against current main\n- Batch 2: MRs [4,5,6] — verified against (main + batch 1 assumed green)\n- If batch 1 passes: batch 2's result is immediately valid\n- If batch 1 fails: batch 2 is invalidated and must re-verify\n\nThis is the Mergify speculative execution model.\n\n### 5.2 Dependency-Aware Batching\n\nMRs within the same epic/convoy should batch together when possible.\nMRs with cross-issue dependencies must respect ordering constraints.\n\n    assembleBatch(queue []MR, config BatchConfig) -\u003e Batch:\n        batch = []MR{}\n        for each mr in queue:\n            if len(batch) \u003e= config.MaxBatchSize:\n                break\n            if mr.blockedBy any MR not in batch:\n                continue  // Can't include yet\n            batch = append(batch, mr)\n        return batch\n\n## 6. Interaction with Witness Decoupling\n\nWith polecat-owned pre-verification and batched merging, the Refinery's\nremaining responsibilities shrink to:\n\n1. Queue management: Assemble batches from scored queue\n2. Stack construction: Rebase MRs in order, detect conflicts\n3. Verification (when needed): Run gates on stack tip for non-pre-verified MRs\n4. Atomic merge+push: Fast-forward merge and push (serialized by merge slot)\n5. Bisection: Isolate culprits when batch verification fails\n6. Bookkeeping: Close MR beads, close issues, delete branches\n\nThe Refinery becomes a lightweight coordinator. The compute-heavy work\n(testing) shifts to polecats (pre-verification) or is amortized across\nbatches (test-on-tip).\n\nWhat the Witness gains:\n- No longer needs to nudge Refinery about stuck MRs (batches clear faster)\n- Zombie detection is simpler (Refinery processes in predictable cycles)\n- Polecat completion is self-contained (pre-verify before submission)\n\n## 7. Migration Path\n\n### Phase 1: Intra-MR Gate Parallelism (LOW RISK)\n- Set GatesParallel: true in MergeQueueConfig\n- This already exists but defaults to false\n- Impact: ~2x speedup on gate suite (test + lint + typecheck run concurrently)\n- No architectural changes needed\n\n### Phase 2: Batch-then-Bisect (MEDIUM RISK)\n- Implement batch assembly and rebase stack construction\n- Implement test-on-tip verification\n- Implement binary bisection for failures\n- Config: BatchConfig{MaxBatchSize: 3, BatchWaitTime: 15s}\n- Start conservative (batch of 3), increase as confidence grows\n- Fallback: if batch fails, fall back to sequential processing\n\n### Phase 3: Polecat Pre-Verification (MEDIUM RISK)\n- Add pre-merge rebase step to mol-polecat-work formula\n- Add MRPreVerification metadata to MR beads\n- Implement fast-path in Refinery for pre-verified MRs\n- Polecats do more work; Refinery does less\n\n### Phase 4: Speculative Parallel Batches (HIGH COMPLEXITY)\n- Implement MaxParallelBatches \u003e 1\n- Implement speculative stack construction\n- Implement invalidation when predecessor batch fails\n- Requires careful orchestration of concurrent git operations\n- Consider: each parallel batch needs its own worktree\n\n### Phase 5: Review Plugin Parallelism (OPTIONAL)\n- Decouple review plugins from merge pipeline\n- Dispatch reviews as parallel polecat/dog tasks\n- Implement verdict collection and gate-checking\n- Only needed if review latency becomes a bottleneck\n\n## 8. Trade-offs\n\n| Aspect | Current | Proposed (Phase 2+3) | Risk |\n|--------|---------|---------------------|------|\n| Throughput | ~4 MR/hr | ~15-20 MR/hr | - |\n| Complexity | Simple sequential loop | Batch assembly + bisection | Medium |\n| Test coverage | Each MR tested independently | Test-on-tip (batch) | Merge-skew caught by cumulative rebase |\n| Failure isolation | Immediate (1 MR = 1 test) | O(log N) bisection | Slightly slower for failures |\n| Resource usage | 1 test run per MR | 1 test run per batch (happy path) | Lower total CI cost |\n| Polecat cost | Tests on feature branch only | Tests on feature + rebased | Higher per-polecat cost |\n| Git operations | Simple rebase per MR | Rebase stack construction | More complex but well-understood |\n| Merge slot | Held during entire MR processing | Held only during push | Shorter lock duration |\n\n## 9. Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Batch-then-bisect over speculative parallel:** Start with batching (Phase 2)\n   before adding speculation (Phase 4). Batching gives 3-5x throughput with\n   moderate complexity. Speculation adds another 2-3x but with high complexity.\n\n2. **Pre-verification as complement, not replacement:** Polecat pre-verification\n   reduces Refinery work but doesn't eliminate it. The Refinery is still the\n   single writer to main (merge slot). Pre-verification is an optimization, not\n   a requirement.\n\n3. **Fast-forward merge semantics:** What you test is what you land. No merge\n   commits that could introduce untested state. This is the bors guarantee.\n\n4. **Existing infrastructure reuse:** The GatesParallel flag, merge slot,\n   MR scoring, and conflict-resolution task patterns all carry forward.\n   The batch layer wraps around the existing gate infrastructure.\n\n5. **Pluggable test command:** The test command is already configurable via\n   MergeQueueConfig.TestCommand. Batched verification uses the same command,\n   just runs it on the stack tip instead of individual branches.\n\n## 10. Open Questions\n\n1. **Stack depth limit:** How deep can the rebase stack go before conflicts\n   become likely? Empirical data needed. Start with MaxBatchSize=3-5.\n\n2. **Bisection vs sequential fallback:** When a batch fails, is bisection\n   always better than falling back to sequential testing? For batch=2,\n   bisection IS sequential. Bisection wins at batch\u003e=4.\n\n3. **Cross-rig batching:** Should the gastown and beads refineries share\n   a batch? No — they operate on different repos. But they could share\n   the merge slot (already the case).\n\n4. **Integration branch batching:** When MRs target an integration branch\n   instead of main, batching still applies. The stack is built against\n   the integration branch HEAD. Landing the integration branch to main\n   is a separate (non-batched) operation.\n\n5. **Flaky test handling in batches:** If a batch fails due to a flaky test,\n   bisection would incorrectly blame an innocent MR. Mitigation: retry the\n   full batch once before bisecting (existing RetryFlakyTests config applies\n   at the batch level).","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-yxx0","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Design complete.
