# Gastown Convoy System

The convoy system tracks batches of work across rigs. A convoy is a bead that `tracks` other beads via dependencies. The daemon monitors close events and feeds the next ready issue when one completes.

+==============================+
```

Two feed paths, same safety guards:
- **Event-driven** (`operations.go`): Polls beads stores every ~5s for close events. Calls `feedNextReadyIssue` which checks `IsSlingableType` + `isIssueBlocked` before dispatch.
- **Stranded scan** (`convoy_manager.go`): Runs every 30s. `feedFirstReady` iterates all ready issues. The ready list is pre-filtered by `IsSlingableType` in `findStrandedConvoys` (cmd/convoy.go).

## Safety guards (the three rules)

These prevent the event-driven feeder from dispatching work it shouldn't:

### 1. Type filtering (`IsSlingableType`)

Only leaf work items dispatch. Defined in `operations.go`:

```go
var slingableTypes = map[string]bool{
    "task": true, "bug": true, "feature": true, "chore": true,
    "": true, // empty defaults to task
}
```

Epics, sub-epics, convoys, decisions -- all skip. Applied in both `feedNextReadyIssue` (event path) and `findStrandedConvoys` (stranded path).

### 2. Blocks dep checking (`isIssueBlocked`)

Issues with unclosed `blocks`, `conditional-blocks`, or `waits-for` dependencies skip. `parent-child` is **not** blocking -- a child task dispatches even if its parent epic is open. This is consistent with `bd ready` and molecule step behavior.

Fail-open on store errors (assumes not blocked) to avoid stalling convoys on transient Dolt issues.

### 3. Dispatch failure iteration

Both feed paths iterate past failures instead of giving up:
- `feedNextReadyIssue`: `continue` on dispatch failure, try next ready issue
- `feedFirstReady`: `for range ReadyIssues` with `continue` on skip/failure, `return` on first success

## CLI commands

### Create and manage

```bash
gt convoy create "Auth overhaul" gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3
gt convoy add hq-cv-abc gt-task4
```

### Check and monitor

```bash
gt convoy check hq-cv-abc       # auto-closes if all tracked issues done
gt convoy check                  # check all open convoys
gt convoy status hq-cv-abc       # single convoy detail
gt convoy list                   # all convoys
gt convoy list --all             # include closed
```

### Find stranded work

```bash
gt convoy stranded               # ready work with no active workers
gt convoy stranded --json        # machine-readable
```

### Close and land

```bash
gt convoy close hq-cv-abc --reason "done"
gt convoy land hq-cv-abc         # cleanup worktrees + close
```

### Interactive TUI

```bash
gt convoy                        # opens interactive convoy browser
```

## Batch sling behavior

`gt sling <bead1> <bead2> <bead3>` creates **one convoy** tracking all beads. The rig is auto-resolved from the beads' prefixes (via `routes.jsonl`). The convoy title is `"Batch: N beads to <rig>"`. Each bead gets its own polecat, but they share a single convoy for tracking.

The convoy ID and merge strategy are stored on each bead, so `gt done` can find the convoy via the fast path (`getConvoyInfoFromIssue`).

### Rig resolution

- **Auto-resolve (preferred):** `gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3` -- resolves rig from the `gt-` prefix. All beads must resolve to the same rig.
- **Explicit rig (deprecated):** `gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3 myrig` -- still works, prints a deprecation warning. If any bead's prefix doesn't match the explicit rig, errors with suggested actions.
- **Mixed prefixes:** If beads resolve to different rigs, errors listing each bead's resolved rig and suggested actions (sling separately, or `--force`).
- **Unmapped prefix:** If a prefix has no route, errors with diagnostic info (`cat .beads/routes.jsonl | grep <prefix>`).

### Conflict handling

If any bead is already tracked by another convoy, batch sling **errors** with detailed conflict info (which convoy, all beads in it with statuses, and 4 recommended actions). This prevents accidental double-tracking.

```bash
# Auto-resolve: one convoy, three polecats (preferred)
gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3
# -> Created convoy hq-cv-xxxxx tracking 3 beads

# Explicit rig still works but prints deprecation warning
gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3 gastown
# -> Deprecation: gt sling now auto-resolves the rig from bead prefixes.
# -> Created convoy hq-cv-xxxxx tracking 3 beads
```

## Testing convoy changes

### Running tests

```bash
# Full convoy suite (all packages)
go test ./internal/convoy/... ./internal/daemon/... ./internal/cmd/... -count=1

# By area:
go test ./internal/convoy/... -v -count=1                       # feeding logic
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run TestConvoy       # ConvoyManager
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run TestFeedFirstReady
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestCreateBatchConvoy  # batch sling
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestBatchSling
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestResolveRig      # rig resolution
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run Integration      # real beads stores
```

### Key test invariants

- `feedFirstReady` dispatches exactly 1 issue per call (first success wins)
- `feedFirstReady` iterates past failures (sling exit 1 -> try next)
- Parked rigs are skipped in both event poll and feedFirstReady
- hq store is never skipped even if `isRigParked` returns true for everything
- High-water marks prevent event reprocessing across poll cycles
- First poll cycle is warm-up only (seeds marks, no processing)
- `IsSlingableType("epic") == false`, `IsSlingableType("task") == true`, `IsSlingableType("") == true`
- `isIssueBlocked` is fail-open (store error -> not blocked)
- `parent-child` deps are NOT blocking
- Batch sling creates exactly 1 convoy for N beads (not N convoys)
- `resolveRigFromBeadIDs` errors on mixed prefixes, unmapped prefixes, town-level prefixes

### Deeper test engineering

See `docs/design/convoy/testing.md` for the full test plan covering failure modes, coverage gaps, harness scorecard, test matrix, and recommended test strategy.

## Common pitfalls

- **`parent-child` is never blocking.** This is a deliberate design choice, not a bug. Consistent with `bd ready`, beads SDK, and molecule step behavior.
- **Batch sling errors on already-tracked beads.** If any bead is already in a convoy, the entire batch sling fails with conflict details. The user must resolve the conflict before proceeding.
- **The stranded scan has its own blocked check.** `isReadyIssue` in cmd/convoy.go reads `t.Blocked` from issue details. `isIssueBlocked` in operations.go covers the event-driven path. Don't consolidate them without understanding both paths.
- **Empty IssueType is slingable.** Beads default to type "task" when IssueType is unset. Treating empty as non-slingable would break all legacy beads.
- **`isIssueBlocked` is fail-open.** Store errors assume not blocked. A transient Dolt error should not permanently stall a convoy -- the next feed cycle retries with fresh state.
- **Explicit rig in batch sling is deprecated.** `gt sling beads... rig` still works but prints a warning. Prefer `gt sling beads...` with auto-resolution.
